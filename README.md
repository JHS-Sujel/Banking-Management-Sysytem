Project: Bank System in C++ with source code


Bank System is based on the concept of recording customer’s account details. 
The system contains only the admin section. 
Here the admin can perform all the tasks like 
creating an account, 
deposit and withdraw amount,
check balance, 
view all account holders detail, 
and modify an account. 
There’s no login system for this project. All the main features of the banking system are set in this project.

About System
Talking about the features of the Bank System, 
an admin can create an account of the customer by providing the name of 
the account holder, account number, and so on. 
Then the admin can also deposit and withdraw money. 
He/she can also check for the balance inquiry which displays the account holder’s name with account number type and amount. 
Also, he/she can view all the account holder’s list. 
Moreover, the admin can also close the account and can modify the account detail as per their wish.

This project uses classes and file handling features of C++. 
Here, the system creates an external file (DAT file) to store all the user’s data, 
so every time we get into the system we can operate with the existing accounts.
